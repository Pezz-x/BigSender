HEY!
WELCOME TO BIG SENDER!!!

If you're like me and want to send speculative applications to multiple companies, you might find it challenging to manually craft and send hundreds of emails. After gathering over 300 email addresses in a spreadsheet, I realized I needed a faster, more efficient way to automate the process while still personalizing each message.

That’s when I created Big Sender!

This tool allows you to streamline the process of sending out mass speculative applications with ease. Big Sender takes a CSV file containing emails and recipient names, then generates personalized cover letters and email bodies addressed to each recipient. It also attaches your CV to the email. The result? Hundreds of individualized emails sent in a matter of minutes.

When I first used Big Sender, I managed to send over 300 emails in just 10 minutes! The results were promising: I received four interview invitations and am currently waiting to schedule second-round interviews.

Tools and AI Assistance
Developing Big Sender wasn’t something I did entirely on my own. I leveraged several AI tools to guide me through the process and overcome challenges:

GitHub Copilot provided code suggestions and helped me structure key functions.
ChatGPT served as a brainstorming partner, helped debug issues, and refined the logic of the application.
CS50 Duck, a tool I discovered while completing Harvard’s CS50 course, assisted with troubleshooting and understanding how to connect the program to Gmail.
By combining these resources, I was able to learn about the methods necessary to interact with Gmail’s API, handle errors effectively, and deliver a reliable tool.

What You’ll Need
To get started with Big Sender, you’ll need a few things in place:

A Gmail Account
This will be the account you use to send the emails.

A Google App Password
Google app passwords are a secure way to grant applications access to your Gmail account. If you’re unfamiliar with how to generate one, you can follow the detailed instructions here:

A CSV File with Recipient Information
Your CSV file should include two columns: one for email addresses and one for recipient names. It should be formatted like this:

email,recipient
malan@harvard.edu,David J. Malan
johndoe@example.com,John Doe

You can easily create this using any spreadsheet program, such as Excel or Google Sheets, and then export it as a .csv file.

A Subject Line
Think of this as your email’s headline. I recommend using the title of the role you’re applying for. For example, if you’re looking for a Project Coordinator role, your subject line could be something like “Application for Project Coordinator Position.”

A Prewritten Email Body
Write a generic email body that you can customize for each recipient. Big Sender will use this as the base for all your emails.

A Prewritten Cover Letter
Prepare a cover letter template that can be easily adapted for different recipients. Ensure it highlights your skills and experiences while leaving space for personalization.

Your CV in PDF Format
Make sure your CV is up to date and saved as a .pdf. This file will be attached to each email.

What Big Sender Does
When you run Big Sender, it will generate two folders for you:

Custom Cover Letters Folder
This folder will contain all the personalized cover letters Big Sender generates for each recipient in your CSV file. Each file is tailored with the recipient’s name and details.

Report CSV Folder
This folder contains a report in CSV format. The report tracks which emails were sent successfully and which weren’t, allowing you to follow up or troubleshoot as needed.

Why Use Big Sender?
Big Sender saves you time and effort, especially if you’re applying to roles in bulk. Rather than spending hours manually addressing emails, attaching files, and copying templates, you can let Big Sender do the heavy lifting. It ensures each email feels personal, even when sent at scale, which can increase your chances of getting a positive response.

Final Notes
While Big Sender is designed to simplify the application process, it’s worth double-checking your templates and recipient list before hitting send. Even with automation, small errors can slip through, so reviewing your materials ensures a polished and professional result.

Whether you're an experienced professional or just starting out, Big Sender can make your job hunt more efficient and effective. Try it out, and you might just find yourself scheduling interviews faster than you imagined!
